## An introduction you should read

I write quite a bit, usually in Markdown (see [[Markdown test]] for an example of how to use Markdown syntax), but I usually keep all my markdown files scattered around my hard-drive. Commonplace is a simple wiki-like system to store and browse your markdown files. It works by reading `.md` files from a directory you configure (my advice would be to keep this directory backed up through [Dropbox](http://getdropbox.com)). The name draws inspiration from [commonplace books](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book).

Commonplace is not meant to be a markdown editor, even though it includes basic editing capabilities. There are a number of tools that do the markdown editing job extremely well - I happen to use [Byword](http://bywordapp.com) for Mac but you get to choose your own poison. If you edit the markdown files in an external editor, changes are reflected here after a refresh.

### Now that you're running this,

I hope Commonplace is as useful to you as it is to me. Let me know ([perhaps on twitter](http://twitter.com/f)) if you need help or have suggestions. If you have code chops, feel free to contribute by sending in your pull requests [on Github](https://github.com/fredoliveira/commonplace).
